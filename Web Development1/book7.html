                    "The Heroes of Olympus" is a series of five fantasy-adventure novels written by American author Rick Riordan. The series is a spin-off of Riordan's previous Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, and follows a new group of demigods as they embark on dangerous quests and battle mythological creatures to save the world from destruction. The main protagonists of the series are Jason Grace, Piper McLean, and Leo Valdez, who are joined by other demigods from both Greek and Roman mythology. The series explores themes of friendship, bravery, and self-discovery, while also incorporating elements of Greek and Roman mythology. The books in the series include "The Lost Hero," "The Son of Neptune," "The Mark of Athena," "The House of Hades," and "The Blood of Olympus." The series has been praised for its fast-paced action, engaging characters, and incorporation of multiple mythologies
