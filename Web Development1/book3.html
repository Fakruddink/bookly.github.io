                    "Radical Gardening: Politics, Idealism, and Rebellion in the Garden" is a book written by George McKay, a British cultural historian and author. Published in 2011, the book explores the history of radical and alternative gardening movements, which seek to challenge dominant social and political norms through gardening practices. McKay examines various forms of radical gardening, including community gardening, guerrilla gardening, and eco-gardening, and the ways in which they have been used to promote environmental sustainability, social justice, and political change. The book also explores the role of gardening in countercultural movements, such as the back-to-the-land movement and the hippie culture of the 1960s and 70s. "Radical Gardening" provides a comprehensive overview of the political and social significance of gardening, and the ways in which it can be used as a form of resistance and activism.
